# Dynamic Programming

## Introduction

This repo contains a package for describing Markov Decision Processes and
solving them using Dynamic Programming.

The formalism and algorithms here are based on chapters 3 and 4 of the
textbook *Reinforcement Learning* (2nd Edition) by Sutton and Barto.

[This repo](https://github.com/Sen-R/sutton-barto) contains a collection
of Jupyter notebooks that use this package to solve exercises from
that textbook.
